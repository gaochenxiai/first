The MAX30102 is essentially an optical sensor (it uses a red light emitter and receiver). 
A heartbeat is a relatively periodic signal. When the heart beats, the blood flows more quickly, and more light passes through. 
By detecting the peaks of the collected digital signal and counting the number of peaks over a period of time, the heart rate can be obtained. 
Blood oxygen saturation (the wavelengths of red and infrared light are different, resulting in different penetration rates). 
Blood oxygen saturation is related to the DC and AC components of the signal. 
Calculate the ratio of AC to DC for both red and infrared light, then take the ratio, and input it into a formula to calculate the blood oxygen concentration value.
